# Risk Perception Survey Intro

The complexity of urban infrastructure and planning led to the phenomenon of Urban heat Islands (UHI), where the temperature in the urban area is warmer than in the rural region. This condition worsens with the prolonged hot weather known as heatwaves, which becomes more frequent events because of climate change conditions. The devastating extreme heatwaves have caused high mortality, which was reported in the Summer of 2023, with more than 70,000 deaths recorded in Europe (Robine et al, 2008). Compared to other disasters, the heatwave can not be seen with the naked eye, making it a challenge for people to understand the risk of it. The city of Padova, Italy, is one of the examples of an urban region in Europe that faces the UHI situation. Known as the fifth largest city in Italy, the urbanization expansion shaped medium-density residential in the city center and sparse complexes in the outer side (Pappalardo, 2023). Due to urban agglomeration activity in Padua, the city faces the soil sealing condition, where an estimated 50% of the surface is sealed, and has become one of the most affected cities by urban soil sealing in Italy (Pappalardo, 2023).
